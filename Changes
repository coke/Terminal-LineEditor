Revision history for Terminal-LineEditor

0.0.9  *WIP*
  [Functionality]
  - Support Linenoise-style tab completion (tab rotates through options)


0.0.8  2021-11-08
  [Bug fix]
  - Make sure history-start and history-end are mappable as special actions

  [Docs]
  - Expand and update README considerably


0.0.7  2021-11-07
  [Bug fix]
  - Fix hang on Alt-<cursor key>; moon-child++ for noticing this


0.0.6  2021-11-07
  [Functionality]
  - Support char and word recasing edit methods, binding word variants for
    uppercase, lowercase, and tclc (title case followed by lowercase)
  - Implement and bind swap-words

  [Refactoring]
  - Simplify cursor position/terminal size detection (patrickb++ for noticing
    that refactoring had left more complex code than needed)
  - Extend word-start/end helpers for repeated use or use at arbitrary buffer
    positions


0.0.5  2021-11-06
  [Incompatible Changes]
  - Rename move-back/forward edit actions to move-char-back/forward to make
    namespace room for word variants; this will be invisible unless you have
    been binding these actions to new keys manually

  - Support (and bind) history-start/end and move-word-back/forward
  - Bind Alt-d to delete-word-forward (previously supported but unbound)

  [Refactoring]
  - Refactor word boundary seeks in SingleLineTextInput to allow many more
    word-based edit methods
  - Factor KeyMappable.decode-keyname out of CLIInput.read-input

  [Bug Fixes]
  - Unbreak runtime require of Terminal::LineEditor::RawTerminalInput

  [Functionality]
  - Support mapping Alt-[normal key], though none mapped yet
  - Add support for load/save history in a history file

  [Refactoring]
  - Split the Terminal::LineEditor::HistoryTracking role out to its own module

  [Docs]
  - Add TYPICAL USE subsection to SYNOPSIS

  [Functionality]
  - Support mapping arbitrary special keys
